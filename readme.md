# Global Liquidity Scene Graph [glsg]

 Extensible, data driven scene graph for babylonjs

 ## Features

* TypeScript all the way
* Simple interface oriented design
* Classic hierarchical [Scene Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph) implementation.
* Extends the existing babylonjs hierarchy. i.e. each SceneElement extends BABYLON.TransformNode
* Message Bus Link for connectivity to message oriented services (i.e. Pusher, PubNub, Realtime.io, Ably, AWS IoT)
* Efficient 3D mesh based, realtime text generator.
* Image Based Lighting and PBR material based "Themes" allow for easy, creative look design. [In Progress]
